    In the near future, scientists manage to create an alpha suit designed for time travel . 
    Having created an alternative universe, he becomes the absolute ruler there. 
    The main character (originally Colonel Michael Swift, but in the final version of the game the hero is anonymous) receives a beta suit 
    (analogous to the alpha suit, but intended for military purposes) and goes back in time in order to stop the destructive actions of Kron.
    Aiden Kron,

    the main villain of the game, goes back in time and changes it. 
    But because the beta suit was not completely finished and the laboratory exploded, an accurate time jump was impossible. 
    The hero came into the past many years late compared to Kron. Now the hero will have to fight hisway to Kron by force.

    After arriving in the alternate time stream, the suit informs Swift that the reverse transport engine on his suit is damaged. 
    Thus, defeating Kron becomes the only chance for Swift to return to the “present”. 


    Almost immediately after arriving, Swift joins the rebels and receives orders from their commander, Cook.

    His goal is a server in the administrative building, which stores information related to Kron and his Magistrate. 
    After successful data collection, Swift is evacuated by airship .

    On board the airship, it turns out that the chronosuit copied absolutely all the data stored on the server. 
    From this data, the rebels learned that the fighters of the Delta battalion were still in captivity, and not executed, as previously thought. 
    Cook orders Swift to release the prisoners of war, after which the rebels have a new goal:
    <img src="http://squarefaction.ru/files/game/1111/gallery/20160821061351_9ac27023.jpg" alt="faction" /> to seize a military plant where the Magistrate's new weapon is being developed. 
    Swift enters the plant and learns that the new weapons were cyborg soldiers capable of controlling time, but, unlike the chronosuit operator, some soldiers could only slow down time, 
    others could only stop it. Swift causes the reactor to overheat and thereby destroys the plant.

    The rebels then capture an airship, which they plan to use to reach the city and put an end to the Magistrate once and for all. 
    Swift and the rebels manage to finish off the remnants of the Magistrate's forces and destroy Kron's headquarters - the Sentinel walker .
    This is followed by a cutscene in which Swift kills Kron with a shot to the head, takes the reverse transfer engine from the alpha equipment and returns to the “present”.

In the final video, Swift is transported to the laboratory three seconds before the bomb explodes. 
He manages to disable the bomb, thereby saving Marissa, Tucker and the rest of the laboratory staff. 
After disabling the bomb, Swift tries to remove her beta equipment, 
but the suit's artificial intelligence reports that a time paradox is inevitable and automatically makes a time jump.
